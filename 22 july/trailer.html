				<blockquote>"American crime drama film about the 2011 Norway attacks and their aftermath"</blockquote>
			</h1>
      <p>July 22, 2011. In the center of Oslo, near the office of the prime minister of the country, a bomb explodes in a bathtub.
         The event causes panic and chaos among the residents. However, it turns out that this is not the only attack of the day.
          Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist responsible for planting the bomb, enters the island of Utoya, where young people associated with the Labor Party are staying at the camp. The terrorist carries out the slaughter, killing 69 people.
           The police manage to arrest the bomber and start his trial. One of the victims of the attack, young Viljar, has to deal with the trauma and face his torturer in the courtroom.</p>

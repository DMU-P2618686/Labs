<!-- There is information about Jonas -->
<div class="model">
<p2>According to IMDb, Jonas has only been acting on-screen since 2014, so he is fairly new to the business. Still, he has started to make a real name for himself. And even if you are still unfamiliar with his name (which you are totally allowed to be, since he has three of them and not just two), you might recognize Jonas’s face from something else he has appeared in.Before he was cast in Ragnarok, Jonas co-starred in the Netflix movie 22 July about the real-life Norway terrorist attack. Maybe Jonas’s prior attachment to the streaming platform didn't earn him his role in Ragnarok on its own, but it might have helped viewers of the new series get to know his face long before the show dropped.</p2>
